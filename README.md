A sassified version of Genesis Sample Theme, with some extra code snippets for optimisation, etc

The main branch is just the Genesis Sample Theme css re-worked into SCSS format, with variables.

I've added a bunch of color definitions (mostly based on the Material Design A400 colours), and some cool mixins (I especially love the choose-contrast-colour() function!)

Changes made to /config:
- changed the primary and secondary colours
- added an additional editor font size and changed the "small" font size from 12px to 14px
- added rems and 404 pages to the Accessibility theme supports
